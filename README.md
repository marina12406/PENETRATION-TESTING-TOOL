Penetration testing tools are used by cybersecurity professionals to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. These tools simulate cyberattacks to assess the security of an organization's infrastructure. Here are some common types of penetration testing tools:

1. **Network Penetration Testing Tools**: These tools scan networks for open ports, misconfigurations, and other weaknesses. Examples include **Nmap** and **Wireshark**.
2. **Web Application Testing Tools**: These tools test and exploit web applications and public-facing portals. Examples include **Burp Suite** and **Metasploit**.
3. **Wireless Network Tools**: These tools focus on Wi-Fi security and identify vulnerabilities in routers and IoT devices. Examples include **Aircrack-ng**.
4. **Social Engineering Tools**: These tools gather information about personnel within an organization to identify potential targets for social engineering attacks.
5. **Post-Exploitation Tools**: These tools help testers gather data and assess the potential damage that could be done if a hacker gained access to systems.
